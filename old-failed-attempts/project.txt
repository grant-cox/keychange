Take a map of local galaxies.

You want to travel in your spaceship from galaxy A to galaxy B, but you can only pass through galaxies
that are connected, and the connection between any two galaxies has a weight of the cost to travel 
between the two, as well as the time required.

Task: What is the minimum time and money required to travel from galaxy A to galaxy B? 


This map of galaxies will be randomly generated by the program. The program will take a list of real galaxies 
and generate a map with randomized (within bounds) weights for price and time of travel.
In addition, the user gives the program the amount of money to start with. 
The program will optimize the minimum time as well as the minimum cost.
